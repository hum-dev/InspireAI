              <p>
                InspireAI Africa Network was born from a simple observation: Africa has tremendous talent, 
                but limited access to cutting-edge technology education. Our founders, a group of educators 
                and tech professionals from across the continent, came together with a shared vision of 
                democratizing AI and robotics education.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as a small workshop in Lagos has grown into a continent-wide network, 
                reaching over 2,500 students and professionals across 15 countries. We've partnered 
                with universities, corporations, and government agencies to create sustainable pathways 
                for tech education and career development.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our community-driven approach ensures that our programs are relevant, accessible, 
                and impactful. We believe that by empowering individuals with AI and robotics skills, 
                we're not just building careers â€“ we're building the future of Africa.
